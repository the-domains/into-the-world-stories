      Have you ever tried to run away from growing up? <br><br>"Every child has
      a favourite place known only to himself/herself. That is their own LITTLE
      world, No one can go in there - even parents and friends. In there they
      feel the wind, based in light, and listen the music." - Shunsuke Okubo,
