  Have you ever tried to run away from growing up? <br><br>"Every child has a
  favourite place known only to himself/herself. That is their own LITTLE world,
  No one can go in there - even parents and friends. In there they feel the
  wind, based in light, and listen the music." - Shunsuke Okubo, dir.-writer.
